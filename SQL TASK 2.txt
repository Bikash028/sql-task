-- 1. Window Function Example: Rank employees within their department by salary
SELECT EmpID, EmpName, DeptID, Salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DeptID ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS SalaryRankInDept
FROM Employees;

-- 2. Subquery Example: Find employees who work in the 'IT' department
SELECT EmpID, EmpName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE DeptID = (SELECT DeptID FROM Departments WHERE DeptName = 'IT');

-- 3. CTE Example: Employees earning above 55000
WITH HighEarners AS (
    SELECT EmpID, EmpName, Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary > 55000
)
SELECT *
FROM HighEarners
ORDER BY Salary DESC;

-- 4. Final Report: Average salary by department using CTE and JOIN
WITH DeptSalaries AS (
    SELECT DeptID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY DeptID
)
SELECT d.DeptName, ds.AvgSalary
FROM DeptSalaries ds
JOIN Departments d ON ds.DeptID = d.DeptID;
